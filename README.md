# A Membership Application Form for the Chaos Computer Club e.V.
- generates a QR code to speed up office work considerably.
- all-in-one file so it's easy to download and use offline.
- mobile friendly form with field validation.
- somewhat sane fallbacks for users with disabled javascript.

## Generating the application form

With the dependencies in `Pipfile` or `requirements.txt` installed,
run `./form.py foerder.j2` to generate the `foerder.html`.
